          <p>
            Conjugating a verb means changing its form to match the other grammatical elements that give it meaning. These elements include things like <strong>tense</strong> (when the verb took place) and <strong>person</strong> (who carried out the verb).
          </p>
          <p>
            Helpfully, many Spanish verbs follow one of three fixed patterns for each tense, with each pattern comprising a specific <strong>verb ending</strong> for each person. Verbs that follow these patterns are known as <strong>regular verbs</strong>, and learning the three patterns for each tense will give you access to thousands of verbs!
          </p>
          <p>
            The pattern of verb endings that we use in each tense depends upon the construction of the verb's <strong>"infinitive"</strong> form.
          </p>

          <h2>The infinitive form (and the stem)</h2>
          <p>
            A verb's <strong>infinitive</strong> is its basic (unconjugated) form &#8212; meaning the
            verb hasn't been changed to match, say, a tense or person. We often precede a verb's infinitive with "to."
          </p>
          <p>
            In Spanish, all infinitives end with either the letters "-ar," "-er," or "-ir." When conjugating a regular verb in a given tense, it is these letters that determine which pattern of verb endings we follow in conveying the relevant person.
          </p>  
          <p>
            The infinitive (or "to") forms of the verbs we'll use in this guide are:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>hablar</strong> meaning "to talk/speak,"</li>
              <li><strong>comer</strong> meaning "to eat,"</li>
              <li>and <strong>vivir</strong> meaning "to live."</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you take away the final two letters of a Spanish verb's infinitive form, you're left with what is known as the <strong>stem</strong>. A verb's stem provides its meaning, and generally doesn't change during conjugation. The stems of the verbs we'll use in this guide are:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>habl-</strong> from "hablar,"</li>
              <li><strong>com-</strong> from "comer,"</li>
              <li>and <strong>viv-</strong> from "vivir."</li>
            </ul></p>
          </p> 
          <h2>Conjugating regular verbs</h2>
          <p> When we conjugate a regular Spanish verb in a given tense, we generally do so in one of two ways:
            <ol>
              <li>
                We combine the verb's <strong>stem</strong> with the relevant <strong>verb ending</strong> for the person carrying out the verb.
              </li>
              <li>We combine the verb's <strong>infinitive</strong> with the relevant <strong>verb ending</strong> for the person carrying out the verb.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The persons we'll refer to in this guide are:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>yo</strong> meaning "I,"</li>
              <li><strong>tú</strong> meaning "you,"</li>
              <li><strong>él/ella</strong> meaning "he/she,"</li>
              <li><strong>nostotros/nosotras</strong> meaning "we (masculine)/we (feminine),"</li>
              <li><strong>vostotros/vosotras</strong> meaning "you (plural; masculine)/you (plural; feminine),"</li>
              <li>and <strong>ellos/ellas</strong> meaning "they (masculine)/they (feminine)."</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>The verb ending patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we've covered the basics of conjugation, it's time to learn the verb ending patterns for each tense.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>There are loads of great resources out there for learning what the different tenses mean and when to use them. So this section doesn't rehash all that information. Rather, you should treat the tables below as simple reference guides to the verb ending patterns for each tense.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The tables featured here use the verbs "hablar," "comer," and "vivir" to illustrate the process of conjugation. However, once you've learned the patterns, you can apply them to any regular Spanish verb.
          </p>
          <p>
          In other words, for any given tense:
            <ul>
              <li>
                all regular verbs ending in "-ar" (also known as "-ar" verbs) follow the pattern of verb endings given for "hablar,"
              </li>
              <li>
                all regular verbs ending in "-er" ("-er" verbs) follow the endings given for "comer,"
              </li>
              <li>
                and all regular verbs ending in "-ir" ("-ir" verbs) follow the endings given for "vivir."
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Present simple (stem + ?)</h3>
          <p>
            We form the present simple tense of a verb by combining the verb's <strong>stem</strong> with the relevant ending:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                The verb endings for regular "-ar" verbs are: <strong>-o</strong>, <strong>-as</strong>, <strong>-a, -amos</strong>, <strong>-áis</strong>, and <strong>-an</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The verb endings for regular "-er" verbs are: <strong>-o</strong>, <strong>-es</strong>, <strong>-e</strong>, <strong>-emos</strong>, <strong>-éis</strong>, and <strong>-en</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The verb endings for regular "-ir" verbs are: <strong>-o</strong>, <strong>-es</strong>, <strong>-e</strong>, <strong>-imos</strong>, <strong>-ís</strong>, and <strong>-en</strong>.
              </li>
          </ul>
